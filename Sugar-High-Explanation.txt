
1. We get the user input from the console.

2. We create a map that stores the candies as keys and their indexes as values.

3. We sort the candies array, so the candies with the least grams of sugar will be at the beginning. 
	We create an ArrayList and a gram counter,so when we use a loop, we 
	can put the allowed amount of grams in the 'gram' variable and we add the original index into the 
	arrayList 'eatenCandies'. The loop stops when we cannot add any more candies to the counter without exceeding the threshold.

4. We sort the contents of the arrayList so the lowest indexes are displayed first
 and store them into a new int array "result". Finally, we return the newly created array.
